# Project Overview

## Atomic Development Stages

### Stage 1: Base Server Network Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- **Interactive network configuration script with optional defaults file**
- **Complete Debian 12 network setup**: packages, static IP, DNS configuration
- **Broadcast video flypack optimized**: systemd-networkd management, no reboot required
- **Clean SSH-safe exit**: avoids dropping connections during network reconfiguration
- **Validation moved to Stage 2**: Ansible QA role will verify network functionality

### Stage 2: Server Provisioning Ansible (Planning)
- **Network QA role**: Validates Stage 1 script effectiveness, go/no-go decision point
- **Base server role**: OS validation, package verification, Python/environment setup
- **Docker host preparation**: User creation, permissions, storage optimization
- **Ansible foundation**: Must support both outer deployment and inner management

### Stage 3: Docker Monitoring Stack
- **VictoriaMetrics/Prometheus/Grafana**: Container orchestration via docker-compose
- **Video-specific metric collection**: SRT, multicast monitoring configurations
- **Persistent storage management**: Docker volumes with backup integration
- **Health checks and auto-recovery**: Container-level fault management

### Stage 4: Flask Web Application
- **Mobile-first UI**: Responsive dashboard for flypack monitoring
- **Ansible orchestration**: Integrated automation via ansible-runner
- **Real-time metrics**: WebSocket streaming from VictoriaMetrics
- **Security**: Role-based access, encrypted communications

### Stage 5: Deployment & Replication
- **Outer Ansible playbooks**: Automated flypack deployment across segments
- **Cross-segment monitoring**: Federation capabilities for multi-flypack views
- **Backup & restore**: Automated configuration and data persistence
- **Documentation**: Complete operational runbooks

### Stage 6: Production Hardening
- **Security auditing**: Compliance validation, vulnerability scanning
- **Performance optimization**: Latency tuning for video broadcast workloads
- **Monitoring & alerting**: Centralized observability and incident response
- **Update management**: Automated patching and version management

## Quality Gates (Applied Atomically)
- **Linting**: Code quality standards across all technologies
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and manual validation at each stage boundary
- **Documentation**: Memory bank updated before stage completion
- **Security**: No-critical vulnerabilities in deployed components
- **Reversibility**: Each stage can be rolled back independently

## Success Metrics
- ✅ **Zero rework**: Each stage complete before progressing
- ✅ **Zero surprises**: Comprehensive testing prevents mysteries
- ✅ **Zero debt**: No technical debt carried between stages
- ✅ **Broadcast optimized**:  Video flypack requirements prioritized throughout
